\section{Rings and Ideals}

\subsection{Rings}

\begin{definition}(Ring)\par
    A ring $R$ is an abelian group with an associative multiplication distributive over the addition. (We always assume a ring has a multiplicative identity and commutative if not marked)\par
    A unit is an element $u$ with a reciprocal $1/u$ such that $u\cdot 1/u = 1$, which is also denoted $u^{-1}$ and called a numtiplicative inverse and the units form a multiplicative group, denoted $R^{\times}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Homomorphism)\par
    A ring homomorphism is a ring map $\phi: R \to R'$ which preserving sums, products and $1$. If $R' = R$ we call $\phi$ an endomorphism and if it is also bijective we call it an automorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Subring)\par
    A subset $R'' \subset R$ is a buting if $R''$ is a ring and the inclusion $R'' \hookleftarrow R$ is a ring map. We call $R$ a extension of $R''$ and the inclusion an extension.\par
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Algebra)\par
    An $R$-algebra is a ring $R'$ that comes equipped with a ring homomorphism $\phi:R\to R'$ called the structure map. An $R$-algebta homormorphism $R'\to R''$ is a ring homomorphism between $R$-algebtas compatible with structure maps.\par
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Group action)\par
    A group $G $ is said to act on $R$ if there is a homomorphism given from $G$ into the group of automorphisms of $R$. The ring of invariants $R^G$ is the subring defined by
    \[R^G := \{x\in R|gx = g\text{ for all }g\in G\}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Boolean)\par
    A ring $B$ is called Boolean if $f^2 = f$ for all $f\in B$, then $2f = 0$ since
    \[
    2f = (f+f)^2 = 4f
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Polynomial rings)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $P:=R[X_1,\cdots,X_n]$ the polynomial ring in $n$ variables. $P$ has the Universal Mapping Property (UMP), i.e. given a ring homomorphism $\phi:R\to R'$ and given an element $x_i$ of $R'$ for each $i$, there is a unique ring map $\pi:P\to R'$ with $\pi|_{R} = \phi$ and $\pi(X_i) = x_i$.\par
    Similarly, let $X:= \{X_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Lambda}$ be any set of variables. Set $P':=R[X]$ the elements of $P'$ are the polynomials in any finitely many of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Ideals)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. An ideal $I$ is a subset containing $0$ of $R$ such that $xa\in I$ for any $x\in R, a\in I$ and closed under addition.\par
    For a subset $S\subset R$, $\langle S\rangle$ means the smallest ideal containing $S$.\par
    Given a single element $a$, we say that the ideal $\langle a \rangle$ is principal. For a number of ideals $I_\lambda$, the sum $\sum I_{\lambda}$ mean the set of all finite linear combinations $\sum x_{\lambda}a_{\lambda}$ for $x_{\lambda} \in R, a_{\lambda}\in I_{\lambda}$. If $\Lambda$ is finite, then the product $\prod I_{\lambda}$ means the ideal generated by all products $\prod a_{\lambda}, a_{\lambda}\in I_{\lambda}$.\par
    For two ideals $I$ and $J$, the transporter of $J$ into $I$ mean the set
    \[(I:J):=\{x\in R|xJ\subset I\}\]
    If $I\subset J$ a subsring such that $I\neq J$, then we call $I$ proper.\par
    For a ring homomorphism $\phi:R\to R'$, $I\subset R$ a subring, denote by $IR'$ or $I^e$ the ideal of $R'$ generated by $\phi(I)$ can we call it the extension of $I$.\par
    Given an ideal $J$ of $R'$ and its preimage $\phi^{-1}(J)$ is an ideal of $R$ and we call ti the contraction of $J$ denoted with $J^c$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Residue Rings)\par
    Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$ and the cosets of $I$
    \[R/I := \{x+I|x\in R\}\]
    have a ring structure and it will be called the residue ring or quotient ring or factor ring of $R$ modulo $I$ and the quotient map:
    \[
    \kappa: R \to R/I,\quad \kappa(x) = x+I
    \]
    and $\kappa x$ is called the residue of $x$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\ \par
    For $I\subset R$ a subring and a ring homomorphism from $R$ to $R'$, then $\ker(\phi) \supset I$ implies that is a ring homomorphism $\psi:R/I \to R'$ with $\psi\kappa = \phi$.\par
    $\psi$ is surjective iff $\phi$ is surjective. $\psi$ is injective iff $I = \ker(\phi)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
    $R/\ker(\phi) \cong Im(\phi)$
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}\ \par
    $R/I$ is universal among $R$-algebras $R'$ such that $IR' = 0$, i.e. for $\phi:R\to R'$ such that $\phi(I) = 0$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $\psi:R/I \to R'$ such that $\psi \kappa = \phi$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    The UMP serves to determine $R/I$ up to unique isomorphism, i.e. if $R'$ equipped with $\phi:R\to R'$ has the UMP too, then $R'$ is isomorphic to $R/I$.
\end{definition}
\Pf\par
    If $R'$ has the UMP among the $R$-algebras $R''$ such that $IR'' = 0$, then $\phi(I) = 0$ and hence there is a unique $\psi:R/I \to R'$ such that $\psi\kappa = \phi$ and since $\kappa I = 0$, we know there exists unique $\psi'$ such that $\psi'\phi = \kappa$ and then $(\psi'\psi)\kappa = \kappa$ and hence $\psi'\psi = 1$ and we are done by the uniqueness.

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $P:=R[X]$ the polynomial ring in one variable, $a\in R$ and $\pi:P\to R$ the $R$-algebra mao define by $\pi(X):=a$, then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\ker\pi = \{F(X)\in P|F(a) = 0\} = \langle X-a\rangle$
        \item $P/\langle X-a\rangle \cong R$
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    (Order of a polynomial)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $P$ the polynomial ring in variables $X_{\lambda}$ for $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and $(x_{\lambda}) \in R^{\Lambda}$ a vector. Let $\phi_{(x_{\lambda})}P\to P$ denote the $R$-algebra homomorphism defined by $\phi_{(x_{\lambda})}X_{\mu} := X_{\mu} + x_{\mu}$.\par
    The order of $F$ at the vector $(x_{\lambda})$ is defined as the smallest degree of monomials $M$ in $(\phi_{(x_{\lambda})}F)$.\par
    We know $\text{ord}_{(x_{\lambda})}F = 0$ iff $F(x_{\lambda}) \neq 0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal and $\kappa$ the quotient map. Given an ideal $J\supset I$ then the cosets
    \[
    J/I:=\{b+I|b\in J\} = \kappa(J)
    \]
    and then  $J/I$ is an ideal of $R/I$ and also $J/I = J(R/I)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Given $J\supset I$ and we know
    \[
    \phi:R\to R/I\to (R/I)/(J/I)
    \]
    then we have the commutative diagram:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        R\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & R/J\arrow[d,"\cong"] \\
        R/I\arrow[r] & (R/I)/(J/I) \\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    Since $\phi(J) = 0$, so there exists unique $\psi:R/J \to (R/I)/(J/I)$ such that $\psi\kappa_J =\phi$ and since $\kappa_J(I) = 0$ and there exists $p$ such that $p\kappa_I = \kappa_J$ and consider $p(J/I) = 0$ and there exists $h$ such that $h\kappa_{(J/I)} = p$ and it is easy to check $h\psi = 1$ by uniqueness and we are done.

\begin{definition}\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. Let $e\in R$ be an idempotent, i.e. $e^2 = e$ then $Re$ is a ring with $e$ as multiplication unit, but $Re$ is not a subring unless $e=1$.\par
    Let $e':= 1-e$, then $e'$ is idempotent and $ee' = 0$ and we call them complementary idempotents.\par
    Denote $\text{Idem}(R)$ the set of all idempotents, which is close under a ring homomorphism.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    If $e_1,e_2\in R$ such that $e_1+e_2 = 1$ and $e_1e_2 =0$, then they are complementary idempotents.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $R:R'\times R''$ be a product of two rings with componentwise operations.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring and $e',e''$ complementary idempotents. Set $R' := Re'$ and $R'' = Re''$. Define $\phi:R\to R'\times R''$ by $\phi(x) = (xe',xe'')$ and then $\phi$ is a ring isomorphism. $R' = R/Re''$ and $R'' = R/Re'$.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    Check $\phi$ is surjective and injective.\par
    There is a natrual isomorphism between $I = \{(0,xe'')\} \subset R'\times R''$ and $R''$, and consider the diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        R\arrow[r] \arrow[d]& R'\times R''\arrow[l]\arrow[d] \\
        R/R'' & R'\times R''/I \\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    and use the UMP.

\subsection{Prime Ideals}

\begin{definition}
    (Zerodivisors)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. An element $x$ iscalled a zerodivisor if there is a nonzero $y$ such that $xy = 0$; otherwise, $x$ is called a nonzerodivisor. Denote the set of zerodivisors by $\text{z.div}(R)$ and the nonzerodivisors by $S_0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Multiplicative subsets, prime ideals)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $S$ is called multipliccative if $1\in S$ and $x,y\in S$ implies $xy\in S$.\par
    An ideal $P$ is called prime if its complement $R-p$ is multiplicative, or equivalentely, if $1\neq P$ and $xy\in P$ implies $x\in P$ or $y\in P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Fields,domains)\par
    A ring is called a field if $1\neq 0$ and if every nonzero element is a unit.\par
    A ring is called an integral domain, or a domain if $\langle 0 \rangle$ or equivalently, if $R$ is nonzero and has no nonzero zerodivisors.\par
    Every domain $R$ is a subring of its fraction field $\text{Frac}(R):=\{x/y, x,y\in R\text{ and }y\neq 0\}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Any subring $R$ of a field $K$ is a domain, and for a domain $R$, $\text{Frac}(R)$ has the UMP: the inclusion of $R$ into any field $L$ extends uniquely to an inclusion of $\text{Frac}(R)$ into $L$. 
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    For any subring $R$ of a field, $a,b\in R$, if $ab=0$, and $a$ nonzero, then $b = 0$ and we are done.\par
    If $\phi:R\hookrightarrow L$, then $\phi(x/y) = \phi(x)\phi(y)^{-1}$ is well-defined and obviously a ring homomorphism and we are done.

\begin{definition}
    (Polynomials over a domain)\par
    Let $R$ be a domain, $X$ a set of variable. $P:=R[X]$ and then $P$ is a domain, and $\text{Frac}(P)$ is called the rational functions.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Unique factorization)\par
    Let $R$ be a domain, $p$ a nonzero nonunit. We call $p$ prime if $p|xy$ implies $p|x$ or $p|y$, which is equivalent with $\langle p\rangle$ is prime.\par
    For $x,y\in R$, we call $d\in R$ their gcd if $d|x$ and $d|y$ and if $c|x,c|y$ then $c|d$.\par
    $p$ is irreducible if $p=yz$ implies $y$ or $z$ is a unit. We call $R$ is a UFG if every nonzero nonunit factors into a product of irreducibles and the facrtotization is unique to order and units.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    If every nonzero nonunit factors have a factorization of a product of irreducible elements, then the factorization is unique up to order and units iff every irreducible element is prime.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    
\begin{lemma}
    Let $\phi:R\to R'$ be a ring homomorphism, and $T\subset R'$ a subset. If $T$ is multiplicative, then $\phi^{-1}T$ is multiplicative; the converse holds if $\phi$ is surjective.
\end{lemma}
\Pf\par

\begin{proposition}
    Let $\phi:R\to R'$ be a ring map, and $J\subset R'$ an ideal. Set $I:=\phi^{-1}J$. If $J$ is prime, then $I$ is prime; the converse holds if $\phi$ is surjective.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal. Then $I$ is prime iff $R/I$ is a domain.
\end{corollary}
\Pf\par
    Consider
    \[
    \kappa:R\to R/I
    \]
    the quotient map and $I$ prime implies $\langle 0 \rangle$ is prime in $R/I$ and hence $R/I$ is a domain.

\begin{definition}
    (Maximal ideal)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. An ideal $I$ is sai to be maximal if $I$ is proper and there is no proper ideal $J$ such that $I\subset J, I\neq J$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    A ring $R$ is a field iff $\langle 0 \rangle$ is a maximal ideal.
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal. Then $I$ is maximal iff $R/I$ is a field.
\end{corollary}
\Pf\par
    Only need to check $\langle 0 \rangle $ is maximal in $R/I$.

\begin{corollary}
    In a ring, every maximal ideal is prime.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
    (Coprime)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, and $x,y\in R$. We say $x$ and $y$ are coprime if their ideals $\langle x\rangle$ and $\langle y$ are comaximal.\par
    $x$ and $y$ are coprime if and only if there are $a,b\in R$ such that $ax+by = 1$.\par
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A domain $R$ is called a Principal Ideal Domain if every ideal is principal. A PID is a UFD.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $R$ be a PID. Let $P:=R[X]$ be the polynomial ring in one variable $X$, and $I$ a nonzero prime ideal of $P$. Then $P = \langle F\rangle$ with $F$ prime, or $P$ is maximal. Assume $P$ is maximal. Then either $P = \langle F\rangle $ with $F$ prime, or $P=\langle p, G\rangle$ with $p\in R$ prime, $pR = P\cap R$ and $G\in P$ prime with iamge $G'\in (R/pR)[X]$ prime.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Every proper ideal $I$ is contained in some maximal ideal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $x\in R$. Then $x$ is a unit iff $x$ belongs to non maximal ideal.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Radicals}

\begin{definition}
    (Radical)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. Its radical $\text{rad}(R)$ is defined to be the intersection of all its maximal ideals. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal, $x\in R$ and $u\in R^{\times}$. Then $x\in \text{rad}(R)$ iff $u-xy\in R^{\times}$ for all $y\in R$. In particular, the sum of an element of $\text{rad}(R)$ and a unit is a unit, and $I\subset \text{rad}(R)$ if $1-I\subset R^{\times}$.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    For a maximal ideal $J$, if $u-xy\in J$, then $u\in J$ which is a contradiction and hence $u-xy$ is a unit. Conversely, if there exists $J$ maximal such that $x\in J$, then $\langle x\rangle + J = R$ and hence there exists $m\in J$ such that $u-xy = m$ for some unit $u$, which is a contradiction.\par

\begin{corollary}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal, $\kappa:R\to R/I$ the quotient map. Assume $I\subset \text{rad}(R)$, then $\kappa$ is injective on $\text{Idem}(R)$.
\end{corollary}
\Pf\par
    For $e,e'\in \text{Idem}(R)$ and $x = e-e'$, if $\kappa(x) = 0$, then $x^3 = x$ and hence $x(1-x^2) = 0$, so $1-x^2$ is a unit and hence $x$ is $0$ and we are done.

\begin{definition}
    (Local ring)\par
    A ring is called local if it has exactly one maximal ideal, and semilocal if it has at least one and at most finitely many.\par
    By the residue field of a local ring $A$, we mean the field $A/M$ where $M$ is the maximal ideal of $A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $A$ be a ring, $N$ the set of nonunits. Then $A$ is local iff $N$ is an ideal, if so, then $N$ is the maximal idal.
\end{lemma}
\Pf\par
    Only need to check the sufficiency, if $A$ is local, then we know $M$ is contained in $N$, and if there is $y\in M-N$, then $\langle y\rangle$ is a proper ideal and hence $y\in N$, which is a contradiction and hence $M=N$ and we are done.

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $S$ a multiplicative subset, and $I$ an ideal with $I\cap S = \emptyset$. Set $\mathcal{S} :=\{J,J\supset I, J\cap S = \emptyset\}$, then $\mathcal{S}$ has a maximal element $P$ and every such $P$ is prime.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    By Zorn's lemma, their is a maximal element $P$ in $S$, for $x,y \in R - P$, there  exists $p,q\in P, a,b\in R$ such that $p+ax\in S, q+by \in S$ and hence $pq+pby+qax+abxy \in S$, and hence $xy\notin P$ and we are done.

\begin{definition}
    (Saturated multiplicative subsets)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, and $S$ a multiplicative subset. We say $S$ is saturated if for $x,y\in R, xy\in S$, then $x,y\in S$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ a subset of $R$ that is stable under addition and multiplication, and $P_1,\cdots,P_n$ ideals such that $P_3,\cdots,P_n$ are prime. If $I$ is not contained in $P_j$ for all $j$, then there is an $x\in I$ such that $x\in P_j$ for $j$ or equivalently, if $I\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^n P_i$, then $I\subset I_i$ for some $i$.
\end{lemma}
\Pf\par
    If $n=1$ then we are done. We may use the induction, assume that $n\geq 2$, then by induction, for each $i$, there is $x_i\in I$ such that $x_i$ is not in $P_j, i\neq j$ and $x_i\in P_i$, so then $x_1+x_2\notin P_2$ if $n=2$. For other $n$, we will know $(x_1\cdots,x_{n-1})\notin P_j$ for all $j$.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $S$ a subset, its radical $\sqrt{S}$ is the set
    \[
    \sqrt{S}:=\{x\in R|x^n\in S\text{ for some }n\}
    \]
    If $I$ is an ideal and $I=\sqrt{I}$, then call $I$ to be radical.\par
    We call $\sqrt{0}$ is the nilradical and denoted as $\text{nil}(R)$. We call $x\in R$ nilpotent if $x\in \text{nil}(0)$, we call an ideal $I$ nilpotent if $a^n = 0$ for some $n\geq 1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal, then
    \[
    \sqrt{I} = \cap_{P\supset I,P\text { prime}} P\]
\end{theorem}
\Pf\par
    For $x\notin\sqrt{I}$, let $S$ contains all the expotents of $x$ and $S$ is multiplicative, then $I\cap S = \emptyset$ and then there is an $P$ prime containing $I$ with not containing $x$ and hence $\sqrt{a}$ contains the union.\par
    Converse direction is easy.

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal. Then $\sqrt{I}$ is an ideal.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    (Minimal primes)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $I$ an ideal and $P$ prime. We call $P$ a minimal prime of $I$ if $P$ is minimal in the set of primes containing $I$, we all $P$ a minimal prime of $R$ if $P$ is a minimal prime of $\langle 0 \rangle$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
A ring $R$ is reduced, i.e. $0$ is the only nilpotent, and has only one minial prime iff $R$ is a domain.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    Converse direction is obvious. If $0$ is the only nilpotent elements, $Q$ is a minimal prime ideal, then $Q = 0$ since $0$ is the intersection of all the minimal primes, and we are done. 

\subsection{Modules}

\begin{definition}
    (Modules)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. An $R$-module $M$ is an abelian group with a scalar multiplication
    $R\times M \to M$ which is
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x(m+n) = xm+xn$ and $(x+y)m = xm + ym$
        \item $x(ym) = (xy)m$
        \item $1m = m$
    \end{itemize}\par
    A submodule $N$ of $M$ closed under scalar multiplication.\par
    Given $m\in M$, its annihilator
    \[
    \text{Ann}(m):=\{x\in R|xm = 0\}
    \]
    and the annilhilator of $M$ is
    \[
    \text{Ann}(M):=\{x\in R|xm = 0\text{ for all }m\in M\}
    \]
    We call the intersection of all maximal ideals containing $Ann(M)$ the radical of $M$, denoted as $\text{rad}(M)$.\par   
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    There is a bijection between the maximal ideals containing $\text{Ann}(M)$ and the maximal ideals of $R/\text{Ann}(M)$, and hence
    \[
    \text{rad}(R/\text{Ann}(M)) = \text{rad}(M) /\text{Ann}(M)
    \]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
    Given a submodule $N$ of $M$, and then $\text{Ann}(M) \subset \text{Ann}(N)$ and we also have $\text{Ann}(M) \subset \text{Ann}(M/N)$.

    (Homomorphisms)\par
    Let $R$ be aring, $M$ and $N$ modules. A $R$-linear map is a map $\alpha:M\to N$ such that

    A subalgebra $R''$ of $R'$ is a subring such that the structure map owning image in $R''$. The subalgebra generated by $x_{\lambda} \in R'$ for $\lambda \in \Lambda$ is the smallest $R$-subalgebra containing $x_{\lambda}$ and we denote it by $R[\{x_{\lambda}\}]$ and we call $x_{\lambda}$ the generators.\par
    We say $R'$ is a finitely generated $R$-algebra if there exists $x_i, 1\leq i \leq n$ such that $R' = R[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$.

    (Cyclic Modules)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring. A module $M$ is said to be cyclic if there exists $m\in M$ such that $m = Rm$, then $\alpha:x\mapsto xm$ induces an isomorphism $R/\text{Ann}(m) \cong M$.

    \[
    \alpha:N\to N/L \to (N/L)/(M/L)
    \]
    and we may know $\ker \alpha = M$. then $\alpha$ factors through the isomorphism $\beta$ in $N\to N/M \to (N/L)/(M/L)$ since $\alpha$ is surjective and $\ker\alpha = M$, so
    \[

\begin{definition}
    (Generators, free modules)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $M$ a module. Given some submodules $N_{\lambda}$, by the sum $\sum N_{\lambda}$, we mean the set of all finite linear combinations $\sum x_{\lambda}m_{\lambda}, m_{\lambda} \in N_{\lambda}$.\par
    Elements $m_{\lambda}$ are said to be free of linearly independent if the linear combination equals to zero implies zero coefficients. If $m_{\lambda}$ are said to be form a (free) basis of $M$, then they are free and generate $M$ and we say $M$ is free on $m_{\lambda}$.\par
    We say $M$ is finitely generated if it has a finite set of generators and $M$ is free if it has a free basis.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $R$ be a PID, $E$ a free module with $e_{\lambda}$ a basis, and $F$ a submodule, then $F$ is free and has a basis indexed by a subset of $\lambda$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $\Lambda$ a set, $M_{\lambda}$ a module for $\lambda\in\Lambda$. The direct product of $M_{\lambda}$ is the set of any vectors
    \[
    \prod M_{\lambda} := \{(m_{m_{\lambda}})\}
    \] 
    which is a module under componentwise addition and scalar multiplication.\par
    The direct sum of $M_{\lambda}$ is the subset of restricted vectors:
    \[
    \bigoplus M_{\lambda} := \{({m_{\lambda}}), m_{\lambda}\text{ nonzero for only finite elements}\}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    $\prod M_{\lambda}$ has the UMP,  for $R$-homomorphism $\alpha_{\kappa}:L\to M_{\kappa}$, there is a unique $R$-homomorphism $L\to \prod M_{\lambda}$ such that $\pi_{\kappa}\alpha = \alpha_{\kappa}$, in other words, $\pi_{\lambda}$ induce a bijection of
    \[\text{Hom}(L,\prod M_{\lambda}) \cong \prod \text{Hom}(L,M_{\lambda})\]
    Similarly, the direct sum comes equipped with injections
    \[\iota_{\kappa} \to \bigoplus M_{\lambda}\]
    and it has the UMP: given $\beta_{\kappa}:M_{\kappa} \to N$, there is a unique $R$-homomorphism $\beta:\bigoplus M_{\lambda} \to N$ such that $\beta \iota_{\kappa} = \beta_{\kappa}$ and $\iota_{\kappa}$ induce the bijection:

\subsection{Exact Sequences}

\begin{definition}

    A sequence of module homomorphisms
    \[
    \cdots \to M_{k-1}\overset{\alpha_{k-1}}{\to} M_k \overset{\alpha_k}{\to} M_{k+1} \to \cdots
    \]
    is said to be exact at $M_k$ if $\ker\alpha_k = \text{Im}(\alpha_k)$. The sequence is said to be exact if it is exact at every $M_k$, except an initial source of final target.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Short exact sequences)\par
    A sequence $0\to L \overset{\alpha}{\to} M \overset{\beta}{\to} N \to 0$ is exact if and only if $\alpha$ is injective and $N \cong \text{Coker}\alpha$ or dually if and only if $\beta$ is surjective and $L =\ker\beta$. Then the sequence is called short exact and we often regard $L$ as a submodule of $M$ and $N$ the quotient $M/L$.
\end{definition}
\Pf\par

\begin{proposition}
    For $\lambda \in \Lambda$, let $M_{\lambda}' \to M_{\lambda} \to M_{\lambda}''$ be sequence of module homomorphisms. If every sequence is exact, then so are the two induced sequences
    \[
    \bigoplus M_{\lambda}' \to \bigoplus M_{\lambda} \to \bigoplus M_{\lambda}'', \quad \prod M_{\lambda}' \to \prod M_{\lambda} \to \prod M_{\lambda}'' 
    \]
    Conversely, if either induced sequence is exact then so is every original one.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par

\begin{proposition}
    Let $0\to M'\overset{\alpha}{\to} M \overset{\beta}{\to} M'' \to 0$ be a short exact sequence, and $N\subset M$ a submodule. Set $N':=\alpha^{-1}(N)$ and $N'':= \beta(N)$. Then the induced sequence $0 \to N' \to N \to N'' \to 0$ is short exact.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
    (Retraction, section, splits)\par
    A linear map $\rho: M \to M'$ is a retraction of another $\alpha:M'\to M$ if $\rho\alpha = 1_{M'}$, then $\alpha$ is injective and $\rho$ is surjective.\par
    Dually, we call $\sigma:M''\to M$ a section of another $\beta:M\to M''$ if $\beta\sigma = 1_{M''}$, then $\beta$ is surjective and $\sigma$ is injective.\par
    We call a $3$-term exact sequence $M' \overset{\alpha}{\to} M \overset{\beta}{\to} M''$ splits if there is an isomorphism $\phi:M\cong M'\oplus M''$ with $\phi\alpha = \iota_{M'}$ and $\beta = \pi_{M''}\phi$.
\end{definition}
    
\begin{proposition}
    Let $M'\overset{\alpha}{\to}M\overset{\beta}{\to}M''$ be a $3$-term exact sequence. Then the following conditions are equivalent
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sequence splits
        \item There exists a retraction $\rho:M\to M'$ of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is surjective.
        \item There exists a section $\sigma:M'' \to M$ of $\beta$ and $\alpha$ is injective
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    Assume the sequence is splits, then we have the commuting diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        M'\arrow[r,"\alpha"]\arrow[rd,"\iota_{M'}"] & M\arrow[r,"\beta"]\arrow[d,"\phi(\cong)"] & M'' \\
        & M'\oplus M''\arrow[ru,"\pi_{M''}"] & \\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    then let $\rho = \pi_{M'}\phi$, then $\rho\alpha = \pi_{M'}\phi \phi^{-1}\iota_{M'} = 1_{M'}$. Let $\sigma = \phi^{-1}\iota_{M''}$ and then $\beta\sigma = \pi_{M''}\phi\phi^{-1}\iota_{M''} = 1_{M''}$ and then $\beta$ is surjective and $\alpha$ is injective.\par
    Now assume there is such a retraction $\rho$ and $\beta$ is surjective, then define $\sigma = 1_M - \alpha\rho$ and $\phi: M \to M'\oplus M''$ by $m\mapsto (\rho(m),\beta\sigma(m))$., if $\phi(m) = 0$, then $\rho(m) = 0$ and $\sigma(m) = m$, which means $\beta(m) = 0$. There exists $a\in M'$ such that $m = \alpha(a)$ and hence $a = 0$ which means $m = 0$, so $\ker\phi = 0$. For $(a,b)\in M'\oplus M''$, assume $\beta(m) = b$, then $\phi(\alpha(a) + \sigma(m)) = (a+\rho(m-\alpha\rho(m)), \beta(\alpha(a)) + \beta(\sigma(m))) = (a,b)$ and hence $\phi$ is surjective. And $\phi\alpha(a) = (a,\beta\sigma\alpha(a)) = (a,0)$ and $\pi_{M''}\phi(m) = \beta(\sigma(m)) = \beta(m)$ and we are done.\par

\begin{lemma}
    Consider this commutative diagram with exact rows:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        & M'\arrow[r,"\alpha"]\arrow[d,"\gamma'"] & M\arrow[r,"\beta"]\arrow[d,"\gamma"] & M''\arrow[r]\arrow[d,"\gamma''"] & 0\\
        0\arrow[r]& N'\arrow[r,"\alpha'"] & N\arrow[r,"\beta'"] & N'' & \\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    It yields the following exact sequence:
    \[\ker\gamma' \overset{\varphi}{\to} \ker\gamma \overset{\psi}{\to} \ker\gamma'' \overset{\partial}{\to} \text{coker}\gamma' \overset{\varphi'}{\to} \text{coker}\gamma \overset{\psi'}{\to} \text{coker}\gamma''\]
    Moreover, if $\alpha$ is injective, then so is $\varphi$; dually, if $\beta'$ is surjective, then so is $\psi'$.
\end{lemma}
\Pf\par
    Notice $\alpha'\gamma' = \gamma\alpha, \beta'\gamma = \gamma''\beta$ and let $\varphi = \alpha|_{\ker\gamma'},\psi = \beta|_{\ker\gamma}$ and we know $\varphi(\ker\gamma') \subset\ker\gamma, \psi(\ker\gamma) \subset \ker\gamma''$. Obviously, $\text{Im}(\varphi) \subset \ker\psi$ and for any $b\in \ker\psi$, it is in $\ker\gamma \cap \text{Im}\alpha$, since $\alpha'$ is injective and hence its preimage has to be contained in $\ker\gamma'$ and hence it is in $\text{Im}(\varphi)$.\par
    $\alpha',\beta'$ will induce natural $\varphi',\psi'$ on $\text{coker}\gamma',\text{coker}\gamma$ by defining $n'+\text{Im}\gamma'\mapsto \alpha'(n')+\text{Im}\gamma, n+\text{Im}\gamma \mapsto \beta'(n)+\text{Im}\gamma''$, which is well-defined since $\alpha'(\text{Im}\gamma') \subset \text{Im}\gamma, \beta'(\text{Im}\gamma)\subset \text{Im}\gamma''$ and the exactness is similarly checked.\par
    Define $\partial$ by the following, if $\gamma'' m'' = 0$, consider $m$ is one of preimage of $m''$ and let $a$ to be the preimage of $\gamma(m)$, then let $\partial m'' = a+\text{Im}\gamma'$. It is well-defined since if $\beta m = \beta n = m''$, then $m-n\in \ker\beta $, which means the preiamges of $\gamma m, \gamma n$ are in the same coset. For $m\in \ker \gamma$, $\partial(\psi(m)) = \alpha'^{-1}\gamma(m) + \text{Im}\gamma' = 0$ and if $\partial(m'') = 0$, then assume $\beta m =m''$ and we know $\alpha^{-1}\gamma(m) \in \text{Im}\gamma'$ and hence there exists $x\in M'$ such that $\gamma\alpha x = \gamma m$ and we know $ \beta(m-\alpha(x)) = m''$ and $\gamma(m-\alpha x) = 0$, which means $\ker \partial = \text{Im}\psi$. If $a = \alpha'^{-1}(\gamma(m))$ with $m'' = \beta m \in \ker \gamma''$, then $\varphi'(a+\text{Im}(\gamma')) = \alpha' a + \text{Im} \gamma = 0$ and if $\varphi'(a+\text{Im}(\gamma')) = 0$, then there exists $m$ such that $\alpha'(a) = \gamma m$ and then $\partial(\beta(m)) = a+\text{Im}\gamma'$ and we are done.

            \item Let $M' \to M \to M'' \to 0$ be a sequence of linear maps. Then it is exact iff for all modules $N$, the following induced sequence is exact
            \[0 \to \hom(M'',N) \to \hom(M,N) \to \hom(M',N)\]
            \item Let $0\to N' \to N \to N''$ be as sequence of linear maps. Then it is exact iff for all modules $M$, the following induced sequence is exact.
            \[0 \to \hom(M,N') \to \hom(M,N) \to \hom(M,N'')\]
        \end{itemize}
    \end{theorem}
    \Pf\par
        Assume $M'\overset{\phi}{\to} M \overset{\psi}{\to} M''$ and then the induced map will be $\tilde{\psi}: f\mapsto f\circ \psi$ and $\tilde{\phi}:g\mapsto g\circ \phi$. If $\psi$ is surjective, then $\tilde{\psi}$ will be an injective since $f\circ\psi = 0$ implies $f = 0$, and if $g\circ\phi = 0$, then $ \ker \psi = \text{Im} \phi \subset \ker{g}$ and hence there will be $g':M'' \cong M/\ker\psi \to N$ such that $g'\psi = g$ by the UMP and we are done. We know for $g:M \to N, g\circ \phi = 0$, equivalently  $\text{Im}\phi \subset \ker g$ iff there exists unique $g':M''\to N$ such that $g' \circ \psi = g$, which means $M''\cong \text{coker}\phi$ and the diagram
        \[

        commutes and we are done.\par
        Similarly assume that $N'\overset{\phi}{\to} N \overset{\psi}{\to} N''$, then $\tilde{\phi}: f\mapsto \phi\circ f$ and $\tilde{\psi}: g\mapsto \psi\circ g$, which means $\ker\psi = N'\hookrightarrow N$. It is easy to check $\ker\tilde{\phi} = 0$ and $\text{Im}\tilde{\phi} \subset \ker\tilde{\psi}$. For $g\in\ker \tilde{\psi}$, since $\text{Im}g \subset \ker\psi = \text{Im}\phi$, then let $g' = g|_N$ will satisfy that $\phi\circ g' = g$. For the converse direction, we know for any $g:M\to N$, $\text{Im}g\subset \ker\psi$ iff there exists a unique $g':M\to N'$ such that $\phi \circ g' = g$, then we may, which is

    By considering the $P\cong M/\ker \phi$ it will induce a section of $\psi:M\to P$ and obviously $\phi:K\to M$ is injective and we are done for (1) implies (2). Use proposition 1.5.6. and we will know there exists $K$ such that $K\oplus P \cong R^{\oplus \Lambda}$ which is free, which is for (2) implies (3). Assume (3), then there exists $\Lambda$ such that $K\oplus P \cong R^{\oplus \Lambda}$. Also notice that we will have
    \[\prod N_{\lambda}' \to \prod N_{\lambda} \to \prod N_{\lambda}''\]
    is exact, which implies that
    \[\hom(R^{\oplus \Lambda}, N') \to \hom(R^{\oplus \Lambda}, N) \to \hom(R^{\oplus \Lambda}, N'')\]
    is exact since $\hom(R^{\oplus \Lambda},N) \cong \prod N_{\lambda}$ and hence
    \[
    \hom(K\oplus P, N') \to \hom(K\oplus P, N) \to \hom(K\oplus P, N'')

        Any two short exact sequences

    \end{lemma} 
    \Pf\par
        Firstly, it is easy to check the two exact sequences are exact. Then consider
        \[
        0 \to K:=\ker(\alpha\oplus\alpha') \to P\oplus P' \to M \to 0
        \]
        which is exact, there exists $\pi:P'\to P$ such that $\alpha\pi = \alpha'$, so we may define $\phi:P\oplus P' \to P\oplus P'$ by $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
        1_P & \pi \\
        0 & 1_P' 
        \end{array}\right)$ which means $(p,p')\mapsto (p+\pi p',p')$ and then $\alpha p+\alpha' p' = (\alpha\oplus 0)\phi(p,p') = (\alpha\oplus\alpha')(p,p')$ where the inverse of $\phi$ will be $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
        1_P & -\pi \\
        0 & 1_P' 
        \end{array}\right)$ and hence $\phi$ is an automorphism.\par
        Notice $L$ is $\ker \alpha$, and for $(p,p') \in L\oplus P'$, denoted $\psi:L\oplus P' \to K$ the induced map by $\phi^{-1}$ and then $\psi(p,p') = (p-\pi p' ,p')$ which is in $\ker(\alpha\oplus \alpha')$ and it has inverse obviously, and hence $L\oplus P' \cong K$, and use the similar construction to $P\oplus L'$ and we are done.

        There exists $G\to F \to M \to 0$ exact with $G,F$ free of finite rank. Let $\mu:R^m \to M$ any surjection and $\nu:= \beta\mu$, let$K = \ker \nu$ and $\lambda = \mu|_K$, then the diagram

        commutes and the snake lemma ensure that $\ker\lambda \cong \ker\mu$, however $\ker\mu$ is finitely generated and hence $\ker\lambda$ is finitely generated, and snake lemma ensured that $\text{coker}\lambda = 0$ and hence $0\to \ker\lambda \to K \to L \to 0$ is exact and hence $K$ is finitely generated and hence $N$ is finitely presented.

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $0\to L \overset{\alpha}{\to} M \overset{\beta}{\to} N \to 0$ be a short exact sequence with $L,N$ finitely presented. Then $M$ is finitely presented.

        exact and $\text{coker}\mu = 0$ and $\ker\lambda,\ker\mu$ are finitely generated and hence $\ker \mu$ is ginitely generated and hence $M$ is finitely presented.

\subsection{Direct Limits}

\begin{definition}
    (Categories)\par
    A category $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of elements, called objects. Each pair of objects $A,B$ is equipped with a set $\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)$ called maps or morphisms. For objects $A,B,C$, there is a composition law
    \[\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B) \times \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B,C) \to \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,C),\quad (a,\beta) \to \beta\alpha\]
    and there is a distinguished map $1_B \in \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B,B)$ such that
    \[
    \gamma(\beta\alpha) = (\gamma\beta)\alpha\text{ for any }\gamma:C\to D,\quad\text{ and }1_B\alpha= \alpha, \beta 1_B = \beta
    \]
    and we say $\alpha$ is an isomorphism with inverse $\beta:B\to A$ such that $\alpha\beta = 1_B$ and $\beta\alpha = 1_A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Functors)\par A map of categories is known as a functor. Namely, given categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}'$, a functor $F:C\to \mathcal{C}'$ is a rule that assigns to each object $A$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and $F(A)$ of $\mathcal{C}'$ and to each map $\alpha$ such that $F(\alpha):F(A)\to F(B)$
    \[
    F(\beta\alpha) = F(\beta)F(\alpha),\quad F(1_A) = 1_{F(A)}
    \]\par
    A map of functors is known as a matural transformation. Given two functors $F,F':\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'$, a natrual transformation $\theta:F\to F'$ is a collection of maps $\theta(A):F(A) \to F'(A)$ such that $\theta(B)F(\alpha) = F'(\alpha)\theta(A)$ for any $\alpha$ and $1_{F(A)}$ trvially form a natrual transformation $1_F$. We call $F$ and $F'$ isomorphic if there are natural transformation $\theta:F\to F'$ and $\theta' : F'\to F$ such that $\theta'\theta = 1_F$ and $\theta\theta' = 1_{F'}$.\par
    A contravariant functor $G$ from $C$ to $C'$ is a rule similar to $F$ but $G(\alpha):G(B)\to G(A)$ with analogous properties with functors.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Adjoint)\par
    Let $F:\mathcal{C} \to  \mathcal{C}'$ and $F':\mathcal{C}' \to  \mathcal{C}$ be functors. We call $(F,F')$ an adjoint pair , $F$ the left adjoint of $F'$ and $F'$ the right-adjoint of $F$ if for any $A\in\mathcal{C}$ and $A'\in\mathcal{C'}$, there is given a natural bijection
    \[\hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),A') \cong \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'(A'))\]
    here natural means that maps $B\to A$ and $A'\to B'$ induce a commutative diagram:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),A')\arrow[d]\arrow[r,"\cong"]& \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'(A'))\arrow[d] \\
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(B),B')\arrow[r,"\cong"] & \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B,F'(B'))
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Naturality serves to determine an adjoint up to canonical isomorphism. Namely, let $F$ and $G$ be two left adjoints of $F'$ and then $F$ and $G$ are isomorphic.
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    Define $\theta(A):G(A) \to F(A)$ by the image of $1_{F(A)}$ under the isomorphism
    \[\hom(F(A),F(A))\cong \hom(A,F'F(A)) \cong \hom(G(A),F(A))\]
    for $\alpha:A\to B$ it will induce the commutative diagram
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),F(A))\arrow[d]\arrow[r,"\cong"]& \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'F(A))\arrow[d]\arrow[r,"\cong"]& \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(G(A),F(A))\arrow[d] \\
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),F(B))\arrow[r,"\cong"]&\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'F(B))\arrow[r,"\cong"] & \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(G(A),F(B)) \\
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(B),F(B))\arrow[u]\arrow[r,"\cong"]&\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(B,F'F(B))\arrow[r,"\cong"]\arrow[u] & \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(G(B),F(B))\arrow[u] 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    where we may know $\theta(B)G(\alpha) = F(\alpha)\theta_A$ and hence $\theta$ is a natural transformation, similarly, define $\theta':F\to G$ and we will have
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),F(A))\arrow[d]\arrow[r,"\cong"]& \hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'F(A))\arrow[d]\arrow[r,"\cong"]& \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(G(A),F(A))\arrow[d] \\
        \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(F(A),G(A))\arrow[r,"\cong"]&\hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A,F'G(A))\arrow[r,"\cong"] & \hom_{\mathcal{C'}}(G(A),G(A)) \\ 
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    which is induced by $\theta'(A)$ and then $\theta'(A)\theta(A) = 1_G(A)$ and we are done.

    \begin{definition}
        (Direct limits)\par
        Let $\Lambda,\mathcal{C}$ categories and $\Lambda$ is small, i.e. its objects form a set. Given a functor $\lambda \mapsto M_{\lambda}$ from $\Lambda$ to $\mathcal{C}$, its direct limit denoted with $\varinjlim M_{\lambda}$ is defined to be the object of $\mathcal{C}$ universal among objects $P$ equipped with maps $\beta_{\mu}:M_{\mu} \to P$ what are compatible with the transition map $\alpha_{\mu}^{\kappa}:M_{\kappa} \to M_{\mu}$, i.e. there is a unique map $\beta$ such that all the diagrams
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            M_{\kappa}\arrow[r,"\alpha_{\mu}^{\kappa}"]\arrow[d,"\beta_{\kappa}"] & M_{\mu}\arrow[r,
            "\alpha_{\mu}"]\arrow[d,"\beta_{\mu}"] & \varinjlim M_{\lambda}\arrow[d,"\beta"] \\
            P\arrow[r,"1_P"] & P\arrow[r,"1_P"] & P
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
        where $\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda}$ is often called a direct system. We know the limit is determined up to unique isomorphism.\par
        We say $\mathcal{C}$ has direct limits indexed by $\Lambda$ if for every functor $\lambda \mapsto M_{\lambda}$, the direct limit exists. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ has direct limits if it has direct limites indexed by every small category.\par
        Given a functor $F:C\to C'$, note that a functor  $\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda}$ from $\Lambda$ to $\mathbb{C}$ yields a functor from $\Lambda$ to $\mathcal{C}'$. Furthermore, whenever the corresponding two direct limits exist, the maps $F(\alpha_{\mu}):F(M_{\mu}) \to F(\varinjlim M_{\lambda})$ induce a canonical map
        \[\phi_F:\varinjlim F(M_{\lambda}) \to F(\varinjlim M_{\lambda})\]
        If $\phi_F$ is always an isomorphism, we say $F$ preserves direct limits.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}
        Assume $\mathcal{C}$ has direct limits indexed by $\Lambda$. Then, given a natural transformation from $\lambda \mapsto M_{\lambda}$ to $\lambda \mapsto N_{\lambda}$, universality yields unique commutative diagrams
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            M_{\mu}\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & \varinjlim M_{\lambda}\arrow[d] \\
            N_{\mu}\arrow[r] & \varinjlim N_{\lambda} 
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    \end{proposition}
    \Pf\par
        We know 
        \[\theta(\mu):M_{\mu} \to N_{\mu}, \theta(\mu)\alpha^{\lambda}_{\mu} = \beta^{\lambda}_{\mu}\theta(\lambda)\]
        and hence consider
        \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
             M_{\lambda}\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & M_{\mu}\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & \varinjlim M_{\lambda}\arrow[d,"\alpha"] \\
             N_{\lambda}\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & N_{\mu}\arrow[r]\arrow[d] & \varinjlim N_{\lambda}  \\
             P\arrow[r,"="] & P\arrow[r,"="] & P \\
        \end{tikzcd}
        \]
    \begin{definition}
        (Functor category)\par
        The functor category $\mathcal{C}^{\Lambda}$, i.e. a category with objects to be the functors from $\Lambda$ to $\mathcal{C}$ and the maps are the natrual transformation, then $\varinjlim$ yields a functor from $C^{\Lambda}$ to $C$.\par
        The direct  limit functor is the left adjoint of the diagonal function $\Delta:\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{\Lambda}$ which send $M$ to the constant functor $\Delta M$ which has the same value $M$ at every $\Lambda$ and $1_M$ at every map of $\Lambda$; for $\gamma:M\to N$ it caarries $\gamma$ to $\Delta \gamma: \Delta M \to \Delta N$ which has the same value $\gamma$ at every $\lambda$.
    \end{definition}
    \Pf\par
        By proposition 1.6.2. we assume $\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda},\lambda\mapsto N_{\lambda}$ and $\theta$ a natural transformation, then
        \[\varinjlim(\theta): \varinjlim M_{\lambda} \to \varinjlim N_{\lambda}\]
        which is uniquely determined.\par
        Notice
        \[\varinjlim: \mathcal{C}^{\Lambda} \to \mathcal{C},\quad \Delta: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}^{\Lambda}\]
        and we want to check
        \[\hom (\varinjlim (\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda}), N) \cong \hom(\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda},\Delta N)\]
        assume $\gamma: \varinjlim (\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda}) \to N$ and then we would like $\gamma \mapsto \Delta \gamma$ is an isomorphism, which is obviously an injection and assume $\delta:\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda} \to \Delta N$ where we know $\delta(\lambda):M_{\lambda} \to N$ which satisfies some commutative diagram and hence there exists a unique $\gamma: \varinjlim (\lambda\mapsto M_{\lambda}) \to N$.

    \begin{definition}
        (Coproduct)\par
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, $\Lambda$ a set and $M_{\lambda}$ an object for each $\lambda\in\Lambda$. The coproduct $\prod_{\lambda\in\Lambda} M_{\lambda}$ is defined as the object of $\mathcal{C}$ universal among objects $P$ equipped with a map $\beta_{\mu}:M_{\mu} \to P$ and the maps $\iota_{\lambda}: M_{\lambda} \to \prod M_{\lambda}$ is call the inclusions.\par
        If $\Lambda$ is empty then $B$ is an object with a unique map $\beta$ to other $P$ and such $B$ is called an initial object.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        (Coequalizers)\par
        Let $\alpha,\alpha':M \to N$ their coequalizer is the object universal among $P$ with $\eta: N\to P$ such that $\eta\alpha = \eta\alpha'$.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}
        A category has direct limits iff it has coproducts and coqualizers. If a category has direct limits, then a functor preserves them iff it preserves coproduct and coequalizers.
    \end{lemma}
    \Pf\par
        Let $\Lambda \mapsto M_{\lambda}$ where $\hom(\mu,\nu)$ is empty for any $\mu \neq \nu$ and then the corresponding direct limit is the coproduct. For $M,N\in\mathcal{C}$ and two morphsims, then the inclusion of them two is a small category and the direct limit will be the coequalizer. If $F$ preserves direct limits, since we have shown that coproduct and coequalizer is special direct limits and we are done.\par
        Conversely, if $\mathcal{C}$ has coproducts and coequalizers. Assume $\Lambda$ a small category and $\lambda \mapsto M_{\lambda}$ a functor, let $\Sigma$ all transition maps and for each  $\sigma = \alpha^{\lambda}_{\mu} \in \Sigma$, set $M_{\Sigma} := M_{\lambda}$ and let $M:= \prod M_{\sigma}$ and $N = \prod M_{\lambda}$, for each $\sigma$, there are two maps $M_{\sigma} \to N$ which is $\iota_{\lambda}$ and the composition $\iota_{\mu}\alpha_{\mu}^{\lambda}$, then let $C$ be the coequalizer of corresponding maps $\alpha,\alpha':M\to N$ aand $\eta: N \to C$ the insertion. So if $\beta_{\lambda}: M_{\lambda} \to P$ compatible with the transition maps, then there is a unique $\beta: N \to P$  such that $\beta\iota_{\lambda} = \beta_{\lambda}$ and hence $\beta\alpha = \beta\alpha'$ and we are done.\par
        If $F$ preserves coproduct and coeqqualizers, then $F$ preserves the construction and we are done.

    \begin{theorem}
        The categories $R$-module and sets have direct limits.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}
        Every left adjoint $F:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C'}$ preserves direct limits.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proposition}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category, $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ small categories. Assume $\mathcal{C}$ has direct limits indexed by $\Sigma$. Then the functor category $\mathcal{C}^{\Lambda}$ does too.
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with direct limits indexed by small categories $\Sigma$ and $\Lambda$. Let $\sigma\mapsto (\lambda\mapsto M_{\sigma \lambda})$ be a functor from $\Sigma$ to $\mathcal{C}^{\Lambda}$. Then
        \[\varinjlim_{\sigma} \varinjlim_{\lambda} M_{\sigma\lambda} = \varinjlim_{\lambda} \varinjlim_{\sigma}  M_{\sigma\lambda}\]
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{corollary}
        Let $\Lambda$ be a small category, $R$ a ring, and $\mathcal{C}$ is sets or $R$-modules. Then functor $\varinjlim:\mathcal{C}^{\Lambda} \to \mathcal{C}$ preserves coproduces and coequalizers.
    \end{corollary}
\subsection{Tensor Products}

\begin{definition}
    (Bilinear maps)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring and $M,N,P$ modules. We call a map $\alpha: M\times N \to P$ bilinear if it is lienarin each variable. Denote the set of all these maps by $\text{Bil}_R(M,N;P)$, it is clearly an $R$-module with sum and scalar multiplication performed valuewise.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    (Tensor product)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring and $M,N$ modules. Their tensor product denoted $M\otimes_R N$ is constructed as the quotient of the free module $R^{\oplus (M\times N)}$ modulo the submodule generated by the following elemants, where $(m,n)$ stands for the standard basis element $e_{(m,n)}$:
    \[
    (m+m',n)-(m,n)-(m',n), (m,n+n')-(m,n) - (m,n'), (xm,n), (m,xn)-x(m,n)
    \]
    and the above construction yields a canonical bilinear map
    \[
    \beta:M\times N \to M \otimes N
    \]
    and set $m\otimes n:=\beta(m,n)$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    (UMP of tensor product)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $M,N$ modules. Then $\beta:M\times N \to M\otimes N$ is the universal bilinear map with source $M\times N$; in fact, $\beta$ induces a module isomorphism
    \[\theta:\hom_R(M\otimes_R N, P) \cong \text{Bil}_R(M,N;P)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    (Bifunctoriality)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring, $\alpha:M\to M'$ and $\alpha':N\to N'$ module homomorphisms. Then there is a canonical commutative diagram:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        M\times N\arrow[r,"\alpha\times\alpha'"]\arrow[d,"\beta"] & M'\times N'\arrow[d,"\beta'"]\\
        M\otimes N\arrow[r, "\alpha\otimes\alpha'"] & M'\otimes N' \\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
\end{corollary}
\Pf\par
    Notice
    \[
    (\alpha\otimes \alpha')(m\otimes n) = \alpha m\otimes \alpha'n
    \]

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $M$ and $N$ modules,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Then the switch map $(m,n)\mapsto (n,m)$ induces an isomorphism
        \[M\otimes_R N = N\otimes_R M\]
        \item The multiplication on $M$ indcues an isomorphism
        \[R\otimes_R M = M\]
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    The switch map induces an isomorphism between $M\otimes_RN = N\otimes_R M$.\par
    Define $\beta:R\times M \to M$ by $\beta(x,m):= xm$, then $\beta$ is bilinear and we have
    for any $\alpha:R\times M\to P$, define $\gamma:M\to P$ by $\gamma(m) = \alpha(1,m)$ and then $\alpha = \gamma\beta$, where $\gamma$ is unique since $\beta$ surjective and hence $M\cong R\otimes M$ since
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        R\times M\arrow[r,"\beta'"]\arrow[d]\arrow[rd,"\beta"] & P \\
        R\otimes M\arrow[ru,"\beta''"] & M \arrow[u,"\gamma"]\\
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    let $P$ be $M$ and $R\otimes M$ and we are done.

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ and $R'$ be rings. An abelian group $N$ is an $(R,R')$-bimoudle if it is both an $R$-module and an $R'$-module if $x(x'n) = x'(xn)$ for all $x\in R,x'\in R'$ and $n\in N$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Flatness}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $\alpha:M\to N$ a homomorphism of modules. Then there is a commutative diagram with two short exacct sequences involving $N'$
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        0\arrow[r] & M'\arrow[r] & M\arrow[rd,"\alpha'"]\arrow[rr,"\alpha"] & & N\arrow[r]& N''\arrow[r] & 0 \\
          & & 0\arrow[r] & N'\arrow[r]\arrow[ru,"\alpha''"]\arrow[ru] & 0 \\      
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    iff $M' = \ker\alpha$ and $N' = \text{Im}\alpha$ and $N'' = \text{Coker}\alpha$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
    (Exact Functors)\par
    Let $R$ be a ring , $R'$ an algebra, $F$ a linear functor from (($R$-mod)) to (($R'$-mod)). Call $F$ faithful if the associated map
    \[
    \hom_R(M,N) \to \hom_{R'}(FM,FN)
    \]
    is injective, or equivalently, if $F\alpha = 0$ implies $\alpha = 0$. Call $F$ exact if it preserves exact sequences, left exact if it preserves kernels and right exact if it preserves cokernels.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $R$ be a ring, $R'$ an algebra, $F$ an $R$-linear functor from (($R$-mod)) to (($R'$-mod)). Then the following conditions are equivalente
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F$ is exact
        \item $F$ preserves short exact sequences
        \item $F$ preserves kernels and surjections.
        \item $F$ preserves cokernels and injections
        \item $F$ preserves kernels and images
    \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\Pf\par
    (1) implies (2),(3),(4) is trivial. (3) implies (2) and (4) implies (2) are trivial. (2) implies (5) by lemma and assume (5), let $M'\to M \to M''$ exact, then $\ker(\beta) = \text{Im}(\alpha)$ and then $\ker(F(\beta)) = F(\ker(\beta)) = F(\text{Im}(\alpha)) = \text{Im}F\alpha$ and we are done.

\begin{definition}
    (Flatness)\par
    We say an $R$-module $M$ is flat over $R$ or is $R$-flat if $M\otimes_R \cdot$ is exact. It is equivalent with that $M\otimes_R \cdot$ preserve injection since it preserves cokernels.\par
    We say  $M$ is faithfully if $M\otimes_R \cdot$ is exact and faithful.\par
    We say an $R$-algebra is falt or faithfully flat if it is so as an $R$-module.
