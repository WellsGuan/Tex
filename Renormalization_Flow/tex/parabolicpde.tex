\section{Parabolic Equation for the decoupling function}

\subsection{Main Theorem}

\emph{Remark.} The space
    \[
    L^1(\mathcal{K};W^{2,\infty}(U;\mathcal{H}_+^m))
    \]
means some functions which are $L^1$ with fixed space point and time varying and $W^{2,\infty}(U:\mathcal{H}_+^m)$ with fixed time point and space varying, with the norm
\[||f|| = \int ||f(t,\cdot)||_{W^{2,\infty}}dt.\]
For two normed spaces, their intersection will be equipped with a norm obtained by adding both the norms together.

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{almost classical solution} to $\eqref{paraeq}$ on a time interval $[0,Q_0)$ is a continuous function $H:[0,Q_0)\times\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathcal{H}_+^m$ such that the following conditions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For every compact $\mathcal{K}\subset (0,Q_0)$ and bounded open $U \subset \mathbb{R}^m$,
        \[
        H_{\mathcal{K}\times U} \in L^1(\mathcal{K};W^{2,\infty}(U;\mathcal{H}_+^m)) \cap C^1(\mathcal{K}\times U ;\mathcal{H}^m_+).
        \]
        where $W^{2,\infty}(U;\mathcal{H}^m_+)$ is the Sobolev space of functions on $U$ taking values in $\mathcal{H}_+^m$ with weak second derivative mearuable ans essentially bounded.
        \item We have $H(0,b) = \sigma^2(b)$ for all $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$.
        \item We have
        \item \[
        
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
